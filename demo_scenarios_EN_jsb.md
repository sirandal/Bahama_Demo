# Bahama Demo Overview



#### Demo Overview

OmniOne aims to create a world based on digital identity that is inherently trustworthy and sovereign to the identity owner (User).

Assuming a trust infrastructure based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT or blockchain) and Decentralized Identity Documents (DIDs) is established, Users can request Issuers to issue Verifiable Claims that can be used to positively establish identity online AND offline through the OmniOne Platform.

As more Users use their OmniOne identity credentials, the more OMN tokens will be rewarded through the OmniOne Platform and those OMN tokens may be used directly as a means of payment, resulting in general socio-economic advancement.

This demo user journey will follow Eliot, a traveler to the Bahamas, and show the convenience of using his OmniOne ID and some of the things that it makes possible during his trip there.

From the moment he enters the Bahamas to the time he returns home, Eliot can experience some of the benefits made possible by OmniOne shown in this demo.



#### Scenario 1: Online Mall

When Eliot, a visitor to the Bahamas, submits his passport to the Bahamas Immigration Service, his passport is digitized and kept by the service. Having access to this important identity data makes the Immigration a perfect Issuer for Eliot's first Verifiable Claim (e-passport). After the Immigration issues Eliot his VC, it is linked to his OmniOne account. Now Eliot can use this OmniOne credential (as a Verifiable Claim) anywhere he might have instead shown his passport (hotel, duty free, bank, etc.)

Eliot arrives in the Bahamas and installs the OmniOne app in accordance with the Bahamas tourism guide and receives a digital ID for visitors through the app. He receives 10000 OMNs for registering.

While in the Bahamas, Eliot finds QR links in a travel guide (brochure or app) to different online malls or services available to visitors.

Eliot, after accessing the online shopping mall, can quickly and securely register an account to the shopping mall by using the OmniOne digital ID through his OmniOne app without creating a separate account on the site. The shopping mall makes use of the Verifiable Claim about Eliot's identity.

The shopping mall is made up of various tourist products from the Bahamas, and the prices are expressed in OMN tokens. Once Eliot selects an item and confirmed purchase, the payment is completed using some of the OMN tokens linked to his account. These are tokens that he has earned by downloading and using the OmniOne app. OMN token balance may be checked in the app by clicking the MY OMNIONE button in the app, he can also see his transaction history.

In Scenario 1, we describe an example of using a user's Verifiable Claim to automatically join a shopping mall that would require KYC, and to use tokens stored on the blockchain and secured with a DID signature.



#### Scenario 2: Offline Shop

Scenario 2 describes a scenario in which a visitor's eligibility is confirmed offline. Eliot scans the offered QR code linked to the store with his OmniOne app. The QR code contains the DID information of the store and the product and price of the good or service that he intends to purchase.

Eliot is able to check the product information and price of the item or service in his app and can electronically sign for purchase using his face or fingerprint (biometric security). He is immediately able to verify the transaction in his transaction history.

The store can confirm the tokens have been paid by Eliot using their store management console.
